# Check_input
This Java program serves as a simple data entry tool. It prompts the user to input the name of a product, the number of pieces, and the price. The program ensures that the user enters valid data types: it accepts a string for the product name, and requires the user to input an integer for the quantity of pieces and a double for the price. If the user inputs an incorrect data type (e.g., a non-integer for pieces or a non-numeric value for the price), the program prompts them to enter the correct type of data. Once all valid inputs are received, it displays the product name, quantity, and price.
